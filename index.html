        <p class="lead mb-4">I am a very hard-working person who is very determined when it comes to figuring out how to solve problems. I can think outside of the box in order to think of solutions to certain problems when needed. Throughout my life, problems and situations have taught me how to not get discouraged or deterred from my goal when things do not go according to plan. Instead of giving up, I take a step back and think about how to make the problem solvable from a different aspect instead of thinking about it in a straightforward aspect. I am also very good at getting along well with new people and communicating with others when problems or conflicts arise. Instead of having a closed mind, I am open minded to new ideas and solutions to a problem. I usually tend to listen to othersâ€™ ideas before inputting my opinion or idea, so it allows me time to think about the different possible solutions. I am also very patient and understanding when it comes to people not knowing what to do. When people come up to me to ask directions on how to do certain things, I do not mind taking time on the side to help them accomplish their tasks. I understand how many newcomers or beginners feel when they join a group, so I make sure to try and welcome them as much as I can when they are under my leadership. I also am not afraid to help other group members and help them take on their problems, as I realize that a group project is really about everyone helping each other in order to achieve a goal. I also attempt to hand out the same difficulty of a task to everyone in the team and not take favorites, especially to me. Additionally, I am also very punctual when it comes to deadlines and meetings. Instead of waiting until the last minute to finish the task at hand, I always finish it ahead of time, so I am not in a rush or under immense pressure when completing the task. The extra time I have before the deadline is used to review the work done and make edits to it in order to make it the best it can possibly be. I am able to push away the distractions and focus on the hand at task. I know when it is time to play and have fun, but also when it is time to get serious. I make time in my day to guarantee that I have time to work on the project and also enjoy my life. I make sure to attend meetings on time in order to ensure that the whole team maximizes the time as best as it can.Adding on to that, I also give my best effort when it comes to completing a task, no matter how menial or boring the task may seem. I take every task and problem with serious consideration and attempt to solve them with serious solutions. 
 <br><br>

        One experience that I have regarding management and administration is creating a club that I was a part of in high school and playing a leadership role in the club. I joined a volunteering club in high school that helped pick up trash and do garage sales and clothes drives to help the needy. During the first year I was a part of that club, I participated in every event held and observed how the leaders of each group led their own groups and which groups were the most effective. I saw that the most effective groups had leaders that were serious, but also very good at communicating things to their groups. The following year, I applied to become a leader of my own group and was accepted. When new people were selected to be in my group, I made sure to welcome them and enlighten them about the groupâ€™s mission statement. As the year went on, there was a group project assigned to each group regarding an informational presentation about everyoneâ€™s groups. This was my first major task as a new group leader, so I assigned everyone equal parts in the project and made sure that everyone understood their tasks and responsibilities. I checked up on everyone throughout the week to make sure all the parts were getting completed and helped out anyone that needed help on their parts. I communicated to everyone in the group to figure out the best day for everyone to meet in order to create the poster board for our presentation. Everyone got to the designated meeting area on time and finished everything on the poster quickly but thoroughly. The group finished all their parts a few days earlier before the final presentation date, so for those last few days, I made sure that everything was clean and organized. Some things were edited and improved in the slides and on the poster board in order to showcase our group the best as possible. On the presentation day, everyone met a little earlier before the presentation in order to rehearse what to say about our group. I provided help to everyone who forgot their lines or could not come up with something to say. Another aspect of management in this club was keeping everything organized and deciding on what days were best for every group member in order to organize volunteering events for us to attend. Since not everyone in the group was from the same high school and everyone had different schedules, communication was very important among the group. Additionally, time management and punctuality were key since everyone had a very busy schedule, so I made sure I arrived on time or before the other group members in order to get everything ready, so once everyone else arrived we were all ready to go, whether it be just attending a meeting or actually participating in a volunteering event. This was a great opportunity for me to hone in my leadership and management skills in order to become a better leader for future clubs or opportunities.

        Another example of an experience I had regarding management and administration was when I joined another school club and applied for the secretary/vice president position. I was accepted and was put in charge of organizing information for the club and helping plan events for the club members to attend. When newcomers joined the club, it was my job to reach out to them and give them the details and the information regarding the club and what they would be doing in the club. I kept track of the hours they put into the club and what events they attended to make sure that they all got the hours they deserved. As secretary, part of my job was to keep track of not only the hours that every member had, but to also keep a file of all the membersâ€™ personal information. Keeping an organized sheet of all the information and hours were important, in case anyone had a question regarding their hours or the president of the club needed to contact one of the members. I attended events to make sure that everything went smoothly and during the event, I also tried to branch out and connect with other organizations that could help our club host events or be a part of their events. Communicating with other people outside of the club that attended the event was important because it gave our club more opportunities to participate in more events and give more opportunities for our members to come and join in.
